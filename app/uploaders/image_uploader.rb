  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  storage :file
  # 내 서버에 저장한다는 것
  # storage :fog
  # 외부 저장소에 저장한다는 것

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:
  def store_dir
    "uploads/#{model.class.to_s.underscore}/#{mounted_as}/#{model.id}"

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:

  # Process files as they are uploaded:
  # process scale: [200, 300]
  #
  # def scale(width, height)
  #   # do something
  # end

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  version :thumb do
    process resize_to_fit: [75, 75]
  end
  version :modalthumb do
    process resize_to_fit: [100, 100]
  end
  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_whitelist
    %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
  end

  # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
  # def filename
  #   "something.jpg" if original_filename
  # end
